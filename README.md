1. This program takes an integer input from the user.
2. It squares each digit of the number from **left to right** using only integer operations.
3. The squared values are merged into a single number.
4. The merged number is then reversed using integer logic.
5. Finally, the encrypted (reversed) number is displayed as the output.
